# üìù Automated Nuclei Segmentation using U-Net ‚Äì README

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered automated nuclei detection system using semantic segmentation. The model is built using a U-Net architecture. The goal is to accurately segment nuclei in biomedical images by achieving 80%+ accuracy while ensuring the model does not overfit.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
This project follows a structured ML workflow:

### Problem Formulation

1. Define the problem: Semantic segmentation of cell nuclei.
2. Set success criteria: Achieve >80% accuracy while avoiding overfitting.

### Data Preparation

1. Load and preprocess images and masks.
2. Apply data augmentation techniques.
3. Split data into training and test sets.

### Model Development

1. Implement a U-Net architecture.
2. Use transfer learning.
3. Train the model with a target accuracy of 80%+.
4. Monitor for overfitting and apply regularization techniques.

### Model Evaluation

1. Assess performance using accuracy and loss.
2. Avoid overfitting using early stopping.

### Model Deployment & Prediction

1. Save the trained model.
2. Deploy the model to to predict nuclei on unseen test data.

### Results

Accuracy: 90% (>80% accuracy achieved)
